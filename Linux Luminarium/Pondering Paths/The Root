## description
In this challenge, I learned how to invoke a program using its absolute path in the filesystem. The task involved accessing a program named pwn located at the root directory (/), which would provide the flag. By using the command /pwn, I applied my understanding of absolute paths to directly execute the program. This exercise reinforced my knowledge of navigating the filesystem and retrieving important information effectively

## Approach
I invoked the pwn program using its absolute path
Flag:pwn.college{kvOeCzEocYJS7-puEbszR7ZBuz7.dhzN5QDLzczN0czW}
